                <h1>About Us</h1>
                <h3>When where we founded?</h2>
                <p>
                    The Denver Nuggets were founded in 1967 as the Denver Larks but changed their name to the Denver Rockets shortly after,
                    originally a charter franchise of the American Basketball Association (ABA).
                    In 1974, the team changed its name again to the Nuggets, anticipating a move into the NBA
                    where a team had already claimed the Rockets name.
                    The Nuggets then joined the NBA in 1976 after the ABA-NBA merger and have competed in the NBA since.
                </p>
                <h3>Why the Nuggets name?</h3>
                <p>
                    The Nuggets are named after the historical association of the state with 
                    the Colorado Gold Rush of the mid-1800s. During this period, 
                    Colorado experienced a significant influx of prospectors 
                    seeking to find gold in the mountainous regions, particularly in the 
                    area around Denver.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The term "nuggets" refers to small, solid pieces of gold that were 
                    commonly found in streams, rivers, and mines during the gold rush era. 
                    These nuggets symbolize wealth, prosperity, and the pioneering spirit that 
                    characterized the era
                </p>
                <p>
                    The name "Nuggets" not only pays homage to Colorado's rich heritage 
                    but also serves as a representation of the team's aspirations for success, 
                    resilience, and treasure-like qualities on the basketball court.
                </p>
                <h3>All time players</h3>
                <p>
                    The Denver Nuggets have had many great players throughout their history, 
                    including Alex English, Dikembe Mutombo, and Carmelo Anthony.
                    The Nuggets have also had a number of players who have had their numbers retired, 
                    including Byron Beck, David Thompson, and Dan Issel.
